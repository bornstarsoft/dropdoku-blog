Sony is reportedly contemplating delaying the release of the PlayStation 6 until 2028 or 2029, primarily due to a significant rise in RAM prices. This situation, dubbed RAMmageddon, is a consequence of increased demand from AI data centers, which has led to a severe memory supply shortage across the tech industry. As a result, both Sony and Nintendo are reevaluating their product strategies to adapt to these challenging market conditions.

The implications of this delay are profound for gamers eagerly awaiting the next generation of consoles. Historically, console prices have dropped over time, but recent trends show an increase in prices for current systems like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. With the potential for a price hike on the Switch 2 and the postponement of PlayStation 6, consumers may need to adjust their expectations and budgets accordingly.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it raises questions about how long gamers are willing to wait for new technology and how these price adjustments will affect their purchasing decisions. Will the demand for next-gen consoles remain strong despite these challenges? Only time will tell.
