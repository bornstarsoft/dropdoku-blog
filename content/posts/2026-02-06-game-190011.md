Hamster Corporation, renowned for its Arcade Archives series, is taking a significant leap into the world of console gaming with the launch of its new Console Archives series. Announced during the latest Nintendo Direct Showcase, this series aims to bring classic console masterpieces to modern platforms, starting with two iconic titles: Cool Boarders and Ninja Gaiden II, available now on Nintendo Switch and set to release on PS5 on February 14.

The Console Archives series promises a nostalgic experience with modern conveniences, including customizable button layouts, screen settings, and save/load functionality. For fans of retro gaming, this initiative not only revives beloved classics but also introduces lesser-known gems like the 1986 Famicom game Doraemon, which has never seen an official Western release. As Hamster continues to expand its library, the excitement for whats to come is palpable. Will you dive back into these classic adventures or experience them for the first time?
