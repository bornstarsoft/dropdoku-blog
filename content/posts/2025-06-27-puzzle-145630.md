Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the gaming landscape with its innovative blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. Revealed in a recent gameplay video, players will find themselves hacking robots through engaging mini-games while simultaneously navigating intense combat scenarios. This unique approach promises to keep players on their toes, merging strategic thinking with fast-paced action.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, Pragmata introduces players to Hugh, a skilled spaceman, and his enigmatic android companion, Diana. The game, which has been in development since its announcement in June 2020, has faced several delays but is now slated for release in 2026. Early impressions from media previews suggest that Pragmata is not only polished but also leaves players eager for more, hinting at a rich experience that could span tens of hours.

As we look forward to its release, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand on these intriguing concepts throughout the game. Will Pragmata set a new standard for the puzzle-shooter genre? Only time will tell.
