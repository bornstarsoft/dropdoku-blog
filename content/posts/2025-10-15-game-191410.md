In a recent interview, Sucker Punch co-founder Brian Fleming emphasized the studio's commitment to remaining a single-project developer after the release of Ghost of Yotei. This decision reflects a dedication to quality over quantity, as the studio believes that focusing on one project at a time allows for deeper iteration and creativity. Fleming noted that while there are many good ideas, the studio can only pursue the best one every five years, making each decision crucial.

As Sucker Punch approaches its 30th anniversary, fans are eager to see whether the studio will revisit beloved franchises like Sly Cooper or InFamous. However, Fleming's insights reveal the internal challenges of balancing diverse expectations from both fans and employees. With a legacy spanning decades, the studio's future projects will undoubtedly be shaped by its commitment to focused development. What do you think Sucker Punch should tackle next?
