The recent cancellation of The Midnight Riders, a promising retro-futuristic adventure game, has left many in the gaming community disappointed. Developed by Bad Brain Game Studios and funded by NetEase, the game was set to deliver a nostalgic experience reminiscent of classics like Stranger Things and It. However, with the studio's impending closure on November 17, the future of this intriguing project hangs in the balance.

Despite the setback, Bad Brain's head, Sean Crooks, has released a captivating five-minute sizzle reel in hopes of attracting potential investors. The trailer showcases a young protagonist, Josh, navigating a world filled with shared nightmares and eerie creatures, all while capturing the essence of 1980s pop culture. The game's unique blend of adventure and horror, coupled with its engaging storyline, has sparked interest among fans and industry insiders alike.

While the cancellation is disheartening, both Bad Brain and NetEase remain open to selling the game's intellectual property. This leaves a glimmer of hope that The Midnight Riders could still find its way to players in the future. As we reflect on this missed opportunity, one must wonder: will another studio step in to revive this captivating project?
