In an intriguing revelation, indie developer Petter Malmehed has linked the decline of his puzzle game, After Hours, to a surprising factor: the communication skills of younger players. As reviews for the game dropped, Malmehed discovered that many players were struggling with a crucial gameplay mechanic that required them to send real-life emails to an in-game character. The issue? A significant number of these emails were sent without proper formatting, with vital information crammed into subject lines, rendering them ineffective for game progression.

This situation raises important questions about the evolving landscape of communication in the digital age. As younger generations increasingly rely on instant messaging and social media, traditional email etiquette seems to be fading. Malmehed's experience serves as a reminder that understanding the tools we use for communication is essential, not just in gaming but in all aspects of life.

As we look to the future, how can game developers adapt to these changing communication norms? Will we see more games that simplify interaction, or will there be a push to educate players on effective communication?
