The October 2025 update for Nintendo Switch Online is set to delight retro gaming enthusiasts with the addition of three classic Super NES titles: *Mario & Wario*, *Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind*, and *Fatal Fury Special*. This update not only expands the library but also brings back nostalgic gameplay that many gamers cherish.

*Mario & Wario* is particularly intriguing as it was originally released only in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1993. Players will enjoy guiding Mario, who is hilariously incapacitated by a bucket dropped by Wario, through various puzzles using a fairy's magic wand. Meanwhile, *Bubsy* returns with his yarn-retrieving antics, and *Fatal Fury Special* enhances the fighting game genre with new characters and classic favorites. 

As Nintendo continues to breathe new life into these classic titles, it raises the question: what other hidden gems from the past might we see in future updates? The excitement for retro gaming is certainly alive and well, and fans are eager to see whats next on the horizon.
