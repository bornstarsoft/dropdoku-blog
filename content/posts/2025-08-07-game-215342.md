In a recent Q&A session, SONY's CFO Lin Tao revealed that the highly anticipated game Marathon is expected to launch by the end of March 2026. This announcement comes after the game's official delay, which was attributed to the need for further refinement and testing. Tao emphasized that while the forecast includes this launch, it is not a firm commitment, indicating that the development team is actively working to resolve existing issues.

Additionally, Tao provided insights into the evolving relationship between SONY and Bungie. Initially, Bungie was granted a degree of independence post-acquisition, but SONY is now moving towards a more integrated approach, aiming to incorporate Bungie fully into PlayStation Studios. This shift suggests a strategic alignment that could enhance the development and release of future titles.

With the gaming community eagerly awaiting updates, the question remains: Will Marathon meet its new timeline, and how will Bungie's integration impact its creative direction? The coming months will be crucial for both SONY and Bungie as they navigate these changes and work towards delivering a game that resonates with players.
