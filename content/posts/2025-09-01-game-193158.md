The upcoming LEGO Pokmon sets are set to revolutionize the world of collectibles, with one of the sets reportedly costing a staggering $650 and containing 6,838 pieces. This makes it not only one of the largest LEGO builds ever but also the seventh largest in LEGO history. The collaboration between LEGO and The Pokmon Company marks a significant shift in the building block market, previously dominated by Mattel's Mega brand.

Scheduled for release on March 1, 2026, the first wave of LEGO Pokmon sets will cater primarily to adult collectors, featuring a 587-piece set priced at $59.99 and a larger 2,050-piece set at $199.99. The anticipation surrounding these sets is palpable, as fans eagerly await the chance to add these unique pieces to their collections.

As we look forward to the launch, it raises an interesting question: how will this collaboration impact the future of both LEGO and Pokmon fandoms? Will we see more innovative sets that blend nostalgia with modern design?
