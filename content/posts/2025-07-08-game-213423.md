In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied reports of its closure following a funding crisis linked to Microsoft. The studio, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, confirmed that while it lost funding for its unannounced first-person shooter project, it remains operational and is actively seeking new publishing partners to revive the project.

The situation has left employees in a state of uncertainty, with some claiming that the entire studio was being let go. However, Romero Games clarified that it is reassessing its staffing and has been approached by several publishers interested in supporting the games development. This statement highlights the resilience of the studio and its commitment to navigating through these challenging times.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the fate of Romero Games serves as a reminder of the volatility within the sector. Will they find a new partner to bring their vision to life, or will this be a cautionary tale for other studios? Only time will tell.
