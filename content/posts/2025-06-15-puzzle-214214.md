In a thrilling development for Red Dead Redemption fans, Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston, has teased an upcoming announcement that could significantly impact the franchise. During a recent livestream, Wiethoff expressed his excitement about news related to the beloved series, hinting that it would be revealed before the end of the week. This revelation comes amid swirling rumors of a current-generation version of Red Dead Redemption 2 being in the works for the Nintendo Switch 2.

Wiethoff's enthusiasm is palpable as he shared, “I’ve got such exciting news, I can’t share it with you right now, and it’s absolutely killing me.” His comments suggest that not only is there something substantial on the horizon, but it may also involve multiple stakeholders within the gaming community.
