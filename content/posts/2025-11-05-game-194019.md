Microsoft has just unveiled the exciting lineup of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in November, and the highlight is undoubtedly the addition of "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7." This title will be available for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers starting November 14, making it a must-play for fans of the franchise.

In total, 11 games will be joining the service in the first half of the month, including intriguing titles like "Dead Static Drive," "Sniper Elite Resistance," and "Pigeon Simulator." However, it's important to note that six games will be leaving the service on November 15, so players should act quickly to enjoy titles like "Blacksmith Master" and "Frostpunk" before they disappear.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, Xbox Game Pass remains a pivotal player, offering a diverse range of experiences for its subscribers. With such a strong lineup this November, what games are you most excited to dive into?
