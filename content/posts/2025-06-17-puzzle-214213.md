Amazon Prime Gaming has just sweetened the deal for subscribers by adding six more bonus games to its ever-growing library. This exciting update comes just in time for Prime Day, allowing gamers to claim and keep these titles as part of their Amazon Prime membership. Among the highlights is the beloved **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered**, which is sure to delight fans of the classic franchise.

Available starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, these games can be claimed through the Amazon Prime Gaming page. The lineup includes a mix of genres, featuring titles like **Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition** and **Saints Row II**. What’s particularly appealing is that once claimed, these games remain in your library indefinitely, even if you decide to cancel your Prime subscription later.

This move by Amazon not only enhances the value of Prime Gaming but also reinforces the platform's commitment to providing quality content to its subscribers. With gaming becoming an increasingly popular pastime, it’s exciting to see companies like Amazon stepping up to offer more for their members. Which of these new titles are you most eager to try out?
