Starting today, VGC is launching an exciting Patreon Christmas pledge drive aimed at expanding our festive content like never before. This initiative not only enhances our community engagement but also unlocks a treasure trove of rewards for our supporters. By contributing to [Patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle](https://www.patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle), you can help fund some of our most-requested future videos, shows, and more.

Throughout December, every new, gifted, or upgraded membership will contribute points to an overall total. As this total grows, we will unveil stretch goals that include deep dives into our magazine archives, guest appearances, and commentary tracks for classic video game movies. If we reach our highest goal, well even announce plans for a special celebration of the site and the VGC Podcast!

This festive drive promises to fill your holiday season with exciting content, all set to be released during December and early January. So, are you ready to join us in celebrating independent games media and unlocking some fantastic rewards?
