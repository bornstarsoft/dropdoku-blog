In a surprising turn of events, Assassin's Creed Shadows has emerged as the best-selling console game of 2025, excluding sports titles and first-person shooters. Despite facing criticism from various quarters, this Ubisoft title has managed to capture the attention and wallets of gamers, showcasing the enduring appeal of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

According to a recent report by Newzoo, the gaming landscape in 2025 has been dominated by established franchises, with sports games from Electronic Arts and titles like Battlefield and Borderlands also making the list. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands out as a noteworthy success story, proving that even in a competitive market, innovative storytelling and gameplay can resonate with players.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how Ubisoft builds on this momentum. Will Assassin's Creed Shadows pave the way for future titles in the franchise, or will the gaming community's sentiments shift once again? Only time will tell.
