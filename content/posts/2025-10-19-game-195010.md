After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is set to finally release in Q4 of 2025, marking a significant moment in retro gaming history. Originally developed by Affinix Software between 1999 and 2001, this tactical RPG was nearly lost to time before a successful crowdfunding campaign by Incube8 Games revived it, allowing fans to experience its unique strategic battle system and immersive storyline.

Infinity promises to deliver an epic narrative, where players navigate a world torn by conflict between rival nations, all while combating an ancient evil. With over 30 explorable areas and more than 100 items, the game is designed to captivate both nostalgic gamers and newcomers alike. The combination of beautiful 8-bit graphics and a compelling plot makes Infinity one of the most anticipated releases for the Game Boy Color.

As we look forward to its release, the excitement surrounding Infinity serves as a reminder of the enduring appeal of retro gaming. Will this revival inspire more developers to revisit and breathe new life into classic titles? Let's hope so!
