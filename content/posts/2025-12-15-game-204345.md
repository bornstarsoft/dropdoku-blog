Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth, is making a triumphant return thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This unreleased gem will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition in 2025, priced at $100. The release not only includes an authentic NES cartridge but also a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled past and Oberth's career, shedding light on the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history.

The revival of Xcavator is more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it highlights the importance of preserving video game history. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, this project serves as a reminder of the rich tapestry of gaming culture that deserves to be remembered. As we look forward to the release, one can't help but wonder what other hidden treasures from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with future generations.
