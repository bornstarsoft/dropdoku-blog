If you're a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost, but only until July 19, 2025. After that date, it will transition to a paid model with a price tag of $1.99, making this a unique opportunity for gamers to experience the first chapter without spending a dime.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous has been designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to be free while subsequent episodes would be sold as downloadable content. Yxtopia Studios has recently announced that the shift to a paid model is aimed at funding future chapters and supporting server infrastructure. The game is not just about scares; it's also about community feedback, which will help shape its development moving forward.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it's intriguing to see how developers like Yxtopia Studios navigate the balance between free and paid content. Will this model become more common in the indie gaming scene? Only time will tell, but for now, make sure to claim your free copy of Haus Of Irndrous before it's too late!
