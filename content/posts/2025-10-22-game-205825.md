Enigmo, the beloved puzzle game originally launched in 2003, has been reimagined for the spatial 3D environment, making its debut as a timed exclusive for the Samsung Galaxy XR. This innovative remake by Fortell Games invites players to engage with their surroundings in a whole new way, using hand tracking and controllers to manipulate puzzle pieces that direct lasers, plasma, and water throughout their space. The goal? To guide each liquid to its designated container, utilizing a mix of strategy and creativity.

With 50 base levels and additional packs on the horizon, Enigmo offers a rich gaming experience that combines classic puzzle-solving with modern technology. Players will encounter various mechanics, including laser beams and teleporters, which enhance the challenge and excitement of each level. While currently exclusive to the Galaxy XR, Fortell Games has plans to expand the game's reach to Meta Quest headsets, promising even more players can enjoy this unique spatial puzzler.

As we look towards the future of gaming, Enigmo's transformation exemplifies how technology can breathe new life into classic titles. Will this shift to spatial gaming redefine how we interact with puzzles? Only time will tell.
