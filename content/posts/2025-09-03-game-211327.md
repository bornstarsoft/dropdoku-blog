Nintendo has officially announced that Forsaken 64 will be the 40th Nintendo 64 game added to the Switch Online library, specifically within the Mature-rated app. This addition marks a significant moment for fans of retro gaming, as Forsaken 64, originally published by Acclaim in 1998, is a unique first-person shooter that offers a distinct gameplay experience unlike many of its contemporaries.

Set in a futuristic world, Forsaken 64 challenges players to pilot a ship through intricate levels filled with robotic enemies. Its unconventional control scheme, which allows for movement in any direction without the influence of gravity, can be both exhilarating and disorienting. This game not only stands out for its gameplay but also for its memorable box art that sparked curiosity and conversation among gamers.

As Forsaken 64 joins the ranks of other classic titles like Perfect Dark and Turok, it serves as a reminder of the rich history of Nintendo 64 games. With the continued expansion of the Switch Online library, one can't help but wonder what other nostalgic gems might make their way to modern consoles in the future. Are there any other classic titles you hope to see revived?
