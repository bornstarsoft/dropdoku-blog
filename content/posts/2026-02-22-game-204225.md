In the thrilling world of Reanimal, solving the Bunker Signal Puzzle is crucial for progressing through the game. After escaping the Orphanage, players find themselves in a bunker where they must input two different codes to escape. This puzzle not only challenges your observational skills but also adds a layer of excitement as the codes change with each playthrough, making each experience unique.

To solve the puzzle, players must first restore power and then use binoculars to observe crates on the beach, which display randomized symbols. Memorizing these symbols is key to inputting the correct code on the terminal. Alternatively, theres a fixed code that players can use to unlock a hidden locker, revealing a collectible poster. This duality in puzzle-solving not only enhances gameplay but also encourages exploration and attention to detail.

As you dive deeper into Reanimal, remember that every challenge is an opportunity to uncover more secrets. Are you ready to tackle the next puzzle and discover what lies beyond the bunker?
