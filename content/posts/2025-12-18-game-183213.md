November 2025 marked a significant downturn in the gaming industry, with hardware sales reaching their lowest point in 30 years. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is particularly alarming given that November is typically a peak month for sales due to Black Friday and holiday shopping.

The average price of a new gaming console hit an all-time high of $439, contributing to a 27% drop in hardware spending compared to last year. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, physical software sales also plummeted, with a 14% decrease compared to November 2024, marking the lowest spending on record since tracking began.

As the gaming landscape evolves, the question remains: how will manufacturers adapt to these economic pressures without sacrificing accessibility for gamers? The future of dedicated gaming devices hangs in the balance as component costs continue to rise, leaving both consumers and industry insiders anxious about what lies ahead.
