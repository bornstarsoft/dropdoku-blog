Stellar Blade studio Shift Up has set a remarkable precedent in the tech industry by gifting its employees substantial bonuses and high-end Apple products, totaling over $4,000 per person. This initiative not only celebrates the hard work of its 300 staff members but also serves as a strategic move to retain top talent in a competitive market. By providing cash bonuses alongside coveted gadgets like AirPods Max and Apple Watches, Shift Up demonstrates a commitment to employee satisfaction and motivation.

This isn't the first time Shift Up has shown its appreciation; previous gifts included iPhone 14s and even prepaid credit cards. Such practices highlight a growing trend among successful companies to prioritize employee well-being and recognition. As Shift Up continues to thrive, with plans for a sequel to its hit game Stellar Blade and a partnership with Tencent, it raises the question: how can other tech companies adopt similar strategies to foster loyalty and drive success?
