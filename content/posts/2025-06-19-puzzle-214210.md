NINES has just announced their latest project, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it’s shaping up to be a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts. This upcoming game introduces a unique twist on the classic tile sliding puzzle, combining adorable visuals with soothing soundtracks that promise to create a relaxing gaming experience. With a gameplay mechanic that challenges players to connect disordered pipe pieces according to a blueprint, it’s sure to engage both casual gamers and puzzle aficionados alike.

Players will step into the shoes of a plumber navigating a construction site, where they must strategically move pipes within a grid-based arena. The game’s design includes a charming support character named ‘Boss’, crafted by the talented PokuriMio, who will guide players from novice to master plumber. This adds an extra layer of personality and engagement, making the journey through Pipeworks Puzzle not just about solving puzzles, but also about enjoying a delightful narrative.

Currently, Pipeworks Puzzle is available for wishlisting on Steam, with exciting features like an endless mode and speedrun challenges promised for those who add it to their lists. A demo is also on the horizon, so be sure to follow the game on Steam to stay updated. As we anticipate its release later this year, one can’t help but wonder how this game will redefine puzzle gaming for a new generation.
