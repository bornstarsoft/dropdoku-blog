In a surprising turn of events, the beloved co-op platformer Pico Park: Classic Edition has become permanently free on Steam due to a developer oversight. Originally intended to be a temporary offer, Tecopark's decision to make the game free has delighted fans and newcomers alike, allowing up to 10 players to engage in its charming puzzle-solving gameplay without any cost.

Pico Park, which first launched in 2016, has garnered a Mostly Positive rating from users on Steam, with 74% of reviews praising its engaging multiplayer experience. The recent update not only added online multiplayer support but also enhanced graphics and various features, making it a perfect time for players to dive into this cooperative adventure. As Tecopark noted, the game will remain free indefinitely, providing an excellent opportunity for gamers to explore the series.

With the gaming community buzzing about this unexpected gift, it raises the question: will this trend of free games continue to grow in the industry?
