Square Enix has just announced an exciting new addition to the gaming landscape: Killer Inn, a 24-player online murder mystery game set to launch on Steam. Developed by Tactic Studios in Canada, this game promises to engage players in a high-stakes environment where strategy, deception, and survival are key. Players will be divided into two teams—Wolves and Lambs—each with distinct objectives that create a dynamic and suspenseful gameplay experience.

In Killer Inn, Wolves must stealthily hunt down Lambs while avoiding detection, while Lambs strive to identify and eliminate the Wolves before they become victims themselves. The unique twist lies in the consequences of misidentification; if a Lamb mistakenly kills another Lamb, they will face dire repercussions. This mechanic adds an extra layer of tension and strategy, as players must carefully analyze evidence left behind by the Wolves, such as hair or clothing fragments, to make informed decisions.

Additionally, the game features an intriguing Focus Mode that allows Lambs to track killers through footprints and other clues, enhancing the investigative aspect of the gameplay. With Safe Zones offering temporary refuge, players will need to navigate their surroundings wisely to survive. As they engage with Castle Staff for quests and information, the path to victory may also involve escaping the castle altogether.

With an open beta on the horizon, Killer Inn is shaping up to be a must-try for fans of online multiplayer games and murder mysteries alike. Will you be ready to uncover the truth and survive the night?
