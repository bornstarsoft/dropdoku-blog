Nintendo's Switch 2 has not only solidified the company's dominance in Japan but has also driven a remarkable 40% growth in the home video game market in 2025. With 3.78 million units sold, the Switch 2 became Japan's fastest-selling console, accounting for over half of all home console sales that year. This impressive performance highlights Nintendo's ability to innovate and capture the hearts of gamers, continuing a legacy that spans more than two decades.

The success of the Switch 2 is further underscored by the dominance of Nintendo games in the best-selling charts, where nine out of the top ten titles were from the Switch and Switch 2 platforms. The standout title, Mario Kart World, sold 2.66 million copies, making it the best-selling game in Japan since 2022. As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be intriguing to see how Nintendo maintains its lead and what new innovations lie ahead for gamers.
