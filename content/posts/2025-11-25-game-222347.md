In a world where creativity knows no bounds, the story of 8-year-old Joey Reyes and her short film about avocado toast serves as a delightful reminder of how children can express profound ideas through simple narratives. At the Like You Childrens Film Festival, Joey's 55-second morality play showcases not just her love for a trendy food item but also the ability of young minds to convey messages that resonate with audiences of all ages.

Joey's film cleverly juxtaposes her enjoyment of avocado toast with the judgmental gaze of her stuffed avocado toy, creating a playful yet thought-provoking commentary on choices and self-acceptance. This unique blend of whimsy and depth highlights the importance of nurturing creativity in children, encouraging them to explore their thoughts and feelings through various mediums, including film.

As we witness more young creators like Joey stepping into the spotlight, one can't help but wonder: what other stories are waiting to be told by the next generation of filmmakers?
