Wildlight Entertainment has finally unveiled Highguard, a game that promises to redefine the PVP raid shooter genre. With its unique mechanics, players form teams of three to build and customize their bases, setting the stage for intense battles. The core gameplay revolves around the strategic use of the Shieldbreaker, a powerful tool that can dismantle opponents' defenses, making raids not just a test of skill but also of strategy.

As players venture out on horseback to gather loot, they must remain vigilant against rival teams also seeking to enhance their arsenal. The introduction of the magical storm that spawns the Shieldbreaker adds an exciting twist, elevating the stakes and encouraging dynamic gameplay. With Highguard now available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the question remains: will this innovative approach attract a loyal player base eager for fresh challenges?
