In an unexpected turn of events, the PS5 has welcomed the release of the 2021 Nintendo Switch exclusive game, Worlds End Club. This action-adventure puzzle game, created by the renowned Danganronpa team at Too Kyo Games, is now available on the PS Store for $24.99. The shadow drop over the weekend has caught many gamers by surprise, especially since there is no PS4 version in sight.

Worlds End Club invites players into a captivating narrative featuring a group of Tokyo school children who find themselves trapped in an underwater theme park after a class trip gone wrong. With its unique premise and engaging gameplay, it promises to deliver an intriguing experience for both new players and fans of the original release on Apple Arcade and Switch.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it raises the question: will we see more unexpected cross-platform releases in the future? The excitement surrounding Worlds End Club may just be the beginning of a trend that blurs the lines between console exclusivity and accessibility.
