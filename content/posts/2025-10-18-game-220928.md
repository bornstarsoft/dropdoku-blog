In a surprising turn of events, former Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Ct has clarified that he did not resign from his position but was instead "asked to step aside" by Ubisoft. This revelation sheds light on the internal dynamics at Ubisoft, particularly as the company undergoes significant structural changes with the establishment of Vantage Studios, a subsidiary partly owned by Tencent. Ct's departure raises questions about the future direction of one of gaming's most beloved franchises.

Ct's LinkedIn statement emphasizes his commitment to the franchise and his surprise at being asked to leave after nearly two decades of service. He expressed gratitude for his time at Ubisoft, while also making it clear that he did not willingly choose to exit. This situation highlights the complexities that can arise in corporate environments, especially during periods of reorganization.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the implications of leadership changes like Ct's will be closely watched by fans and industry insiders alike. Will Ubisoft's new leadership be able to maintain the legacy of Assassin's Creed, or will this transition lead to a new era for the franchise? Only time will tell.
