Sega has officially announced the Puyo Puyo Global Ranking Series 2025, marking a significant milestone in the world of competitive puzzle gaming. With over 39 million players globally, this tournament circuit aims to crown the first-ever world champion of Puyo Puyo, a beloved tile-matching puzzler. This initiative not only elevates the gameâ€™s status within the esports realm but also showcases Sega's commitment to nurturing a competitive community around it.

The tournament structure incorporates a point system derived from various online competitions, including both Sega-organized events and grassroots tournaments. This approach mirrors established circuits in the fighting game community, such as the Capcom Pro Tour and Tekken World Tour, which have successfully built vibrant competitive landscapes. Players from Japan and beyond will accumulate points throughout the year, with the top contenders invited to the prestigious Puyo Puyo Gran Prix Final in February 2026.

As the competitive scene for puzzle games continues to grow, the backing of a major publisher like Sega is a game-changer. It not only legitimizes Puyo Puyo as an esport but also inspires other puzzle games to explore similar paths. Will we see more classic titles joining the competitive arena, or will Puyo Puyo stand alone as the flagship of puzzle esports? Only time will tell.
