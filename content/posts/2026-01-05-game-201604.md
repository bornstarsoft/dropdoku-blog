In an impressive display of employee appreciation, Shift Up Corporation has once again set the bar high by gifting every one of its 300 employees with Apple AirPods Max, an Apple Watch, and a generous bonus of 5 million KRW. This remarkable gesture comes as part of their New Year kickoff ceremony, showcasing the company's commitment to rewarding its talented workforce.

Shift Up Corporation, known for its successful titles like Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Stellar Blade, has a history of lavish gifts for its employees. Last year alone, they provided iPhone 14s, PlayStation 5 Pros, and even a preloaded credit card worth 10 million KRW to celebrate their 10th anniversary. With a reported revenue of 219.9 billion KRW and an operating profit margin of 67.6%, its clear that their financial success translates into tangible rewards for their team.

As the company continues to thrive and develop exciting new projects, such as the sequel to Stellar Blade, one can't help but wonder how this culture of generosity will impact employee morale and productivity in the long run. Will other companies follow suit in recognizing the value of investing in their employees?
