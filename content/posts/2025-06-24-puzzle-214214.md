BitSummit 2025 is set to be an exhilarating showcase of indie creativity, featuring a remarkable lineup of 120 games from Japan and around the globe. Taking place at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto from July 19 to 21, this year's event promises to be a vibrant celebration of innovative game development, with the theme "Summer of Yokai" honoring the supernatural creatures of Japanese folklore.

Founded in 2012 by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), BitSummit has grown from a modest gathering of 200 attendees to a major event that attracted over 38,000 visitors last year. The co-founder, John Davis, expressed his excitement about the diverse submissions received, emphasizing the festival's mission to champion bold ideas and foster a community of passionate creators. This year, the event will not only cater to industry professionals on the first day but will also open its doors to the public over the weekend, making it an unmissable experience for gaming enthusiasts.

As the anticipation builds, the gaming community is eager to see how this year's selections will push the boundaries of creativity and storytelling in indie games. Are you ready to dive into the world of indie gaming at BitSummit 2025?
