The gaming community is buzzing with excitement and intrigue following the leak of a pre-release build for Sony Interactive Studios and Firewalk Studios’ ambitious project, Concord. This build, named FWChaos, reportedly dates back to November 14, 2023, a significant nine months prior to the game’s anticipated launch in August 2024. The authenticity of the build has been confirmed by VGC, raising questions about the game's development and future.

Upon loading the game, players are greeted with a login screen that cannot be bypassed. However, the inclusion of an .ini file allows access to a developer menu, revealing a glimpse into the game's mechanics. The Select Freegunner screen appears, but players are met with a frustrating limitation: no Freegunners are available for selection. Despite this, the game does provide access to a Main Menu, showcasing various unfinished features such as a Galactic Guide, character information, and a Job Board filled with placeholder text.

This leak not only sheds light on the current state of Concord but also highlights the challenges developers face in bringing ambitious projects to life. As fans eagerly await further updates, one has to wonder: what does this mean for the future of Concord and the gaming landscape as a whole?
