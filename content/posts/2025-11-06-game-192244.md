In a surprising turn of events, NetEase Games has announced the closure of Bad Brain Game Studios, a Montreal-based game developer it established just two years ago. Studio head Sean Crooks revealed in a LinkedIn post that the studio will officially close its doors on November 17. This news comes as a shock to many, especially considering that the studio was in the process of developing an intriguing title code-named "The Midnight Riders," which promised an 80s-themed action-adventure experience.

Despite the closure, NetEase Games remains optimistic about the future of the project. The company has indicated that both the game and its intellectual property are available for acquisition or partnership, inviting publishers to explore the potential of continuing its development. This could be an opportunity for other developers to step in and bring "The Midnight Riders" to life, potentially reviving interest in retro-themed gaming.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it raises questions about the sustainability of new studios in a competitive market. Will we see more closures like this, or will the opportunity for acquisition lead to a resurgence of innovative titles?
