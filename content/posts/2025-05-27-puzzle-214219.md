In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only sets high expectations but also highlights the ongoing demand for innovative puzzle games in the gaming community. With *Portal 2* being a benchmark in the genre, Pixel Maniacs is stepping up to fill a void left by Valve's reluctance to produce a third installment.

The gameplay mechanics of *ChromaGun 2* feature a unique twist on the first-person shooter puzzle format, where players utilize a color-changing gun to manipulate objects within the environment. While the aesthetic and setting may evoke memories of *Portal*, the puzzle-solving elements draw more parallels to games like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. This divergence suggests that while *ChromaGun 2* pays homage to its predecessors, it aims to carve out its own identity in the puzzle genre.

For those eager to experience this fresh take on puzzle-solving, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to dive into the colorful world of *ChromaGun 2* before its full release. With the original *ChromaGun* receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 launch, expectations are high for this sequel. Will it live up to the legacy of *Portal* and redefine the puzzle genre once again? Only time will tell.
