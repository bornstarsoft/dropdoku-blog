The recent AWS outage that disrupted popular online games like Wordle highlights the deep connection players have with their daily gaming routines. For many, the loss of a streak in a game theyve invested time and effort into can lead to genuine stress and anxiety. As players like Alec Laurie and Micah Willbrand experienced, the fear of losing progress in a beloved game reveals just how integral these digital experiences have become in our lives.

With millions of users relying on platforms like Wordle, the ripple effects of such outages can be significant. Players not only lose their streaks but also face the emotional turmoil of potentially losing their hard-earned achievements. The incident serves as a reminder of the fragility of our digital dependencies and the importance of robust infrastructure in maintaining these online communities.

As we continue to embrace technology in our daily lives, how can we better prepare for and mitigate the impact of such outages?
