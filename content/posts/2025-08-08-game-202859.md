The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Nightdive Studios and id Software unveil the definitive remasters of the classic first-person shooters, Heretic and Hexen. This bundle not only revitalizes these iconic titles for modern platforms but also introduces two brand new episodes, promising both nostalgia and fresh content for fans old and new.

Originally released in the mid-90s, Heretic and Hexen pushed the boundaries of FPS gameplay with their dark fantasy themes and innovative mechanics. The remasters, available on a variety of platforms including PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, feature stunning enhancements such as up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second. Additionally, players can dive into new chapters crafted by the original developers, making this release a must-have for any serious gamer.

With local split-screen for up to 8 players and online multiplayer support for 16, the remasters not only pay homage to the originals but also expand their legacy. As we look forward to more remasters that blend nostalgia with modern gaming experiences, one has to wonder: what classic titles will get the same treatment next?
