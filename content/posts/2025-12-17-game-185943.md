November 2025 marked a significant month for the livestreaming landscape in China, particularly for anime-style RPGs. According to the Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, these games have captured the attention of millions, with major updates and anniversary events driving viewership to new heights. Titles like Kuro Games Wuthering Waves and miHoYos Zenless Zone Zero showcased impressive viewer numbers, highlighting the genre's growing popularity.

Wuthering Waves, for instance, saw a staggering 36.5 million viewers, a 103% increase from the previous month, thanks to its Version 2.8 preview livestream. Similarly, Zenless Zone Zero attracted 30.9 million viewers, boosted by its own significant update. These figures underscore the importance of streaming platforms like Bilibili, which have become essential venues for engaging with the younger audience that thrives on ACGN culture.

As we look ahead, the success of these titles raises an intriguing question: how will the evolving landscape of livestreaming continue to shape the gaming experience for fans around the world? The future seems bright for RPGs, and it will be exciting to see how developers leverage these platforms to connect with their audiences.
